  <p>Hi!I'm Simone. I'm 16 years old, and a rising junior at Chantilly High School. I enjoy animals, computers, cooking, music, tea, hot chocolate, shirley Temples, Online Quizzes, Movies, Rain, Oversized Hoodies, and Baking. I dislike when people eat with their mouths open, people who are mean to animals, and rude people. </p>
